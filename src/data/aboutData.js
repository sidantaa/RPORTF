    "I am software Engineer at Pikessoft, currently working as React Native Developer. A project that I worked on towards the end of my Bachelor's in History set me on this path of a Mobile Application Developer. The Mobile App was not the focus of the project, but working on it was such a thrilling experience that a career in this felt like a right fit. Other than this I just loves reading books.",
